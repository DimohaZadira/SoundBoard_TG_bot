# SoundBoard TG bot!
## How to build

The project is maintained with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). To run the bot populate your environment variables (consult the [.env section](#env)), run a database (potentially, locally, [for development](#spin-up-a-development-environment)) and run the bot with

```
poetry run python bot.py
```

To build distributions of this project run

```
poetry build
```

## Supported commands:
`/start`:
Adds user to the database. Responses "_Hi there! There is a list of my functions:
1) /add_sound <sound_name>. Use it in order to add a new sound into my storage. This sound will be available by this name later on. ➕
2) /list_sounds. Use it to view the list of sounds you added earlier that are currently available. 📌
3) /delete_sound <sound_name>. I suppose it's pretty clear what this command does 🧐
4) (inline) @myBotName <sound_name>. Use this command from any chat you want and choose your <sound_name>. I will send a voice message that contains your .mp3 file assosiated with this name. 🔊_"

`/list_sounds`:
Prints the list of sounds that were added by user and are currently available. Responses "Your sounds are:\n📌<sound_name_1>\n📌<sound_name_2> etc..."
If there are not any sounds, responds "_There are not any sounds in your collection! Feel free to add ones by using command /add_sound <sound_name>_"

`/add_sound <sound_name>`:
Waits for user to send a message with `.mp3` file attached. Adds this file to storage system and assosiates it with <sound_name>. This sound will be available by this name.
Following commands with the same <sound_name> will be ignored. If need to rewrite sound, use the `/delete_sound` command.

If there is no <sound_name>, responses "_Please tell me how to name a sound you want to attach! Tell me /add_sound <sound_name>_ ❌🤔" and does nothing else.

If there is already a file attached to <sound_name>, responses "_I already have a sound with that name! Please come up with something else!_ ❌😒"

If everything is OK, responses "Got it! Now please send a message with .mp3 file attached...".

###
Handling the next message:

If there is no file attached, responses "_Seems like there is no .mp3 file attached!_ ❌🧐" and does nothing else.

If there are more than one file attached, responses "_Seems like there are too many files!_ ❌🤓" and does nothing else.

If summary amount of disk space allocated for this user exceeds 100mb, responses "_Your disk space limit is reached! Try deleting some unused sounds first!_ ❌😢" and does nothing else.

If everything is OK, responses "_Good job! Your sound has been successfully added! Try sending it to somebody using @MyBotName inline command!_ ✅😎".

If there were no file since last execution of this command for this user and the current one is OK, responses "_Good job! Your sound has been successfully added! Previous attempts are forgotten!_ 🟨✅".

`/delete_sound <sound_name>`:

Deletes `.mp3` file assosiated with entered name from storage.

If there is no file assosiated with entered name, responses "_Didn't find a file assosiated with entered name "<sound_name>" in my storage!_ ❌😲" and does nothing else.

If everything is OK, responses "_This sound has been successfully deleted!_ ✅👾".

`@MyBotName <sound_name>` (inline bot's function):
Sends voice message containing a file assosiated with <sound_name>.
If there is no file assosiated with entered name, responses "_Didn't finda file assosiated with entered name "<sound_name>" in my storage!_ ❌😲" and does nothing else.

## .env:
```.env
BOT_NAME=

BOT_TOKEN=<bot api token>

DB_HOST=<host with postgresql>

DB_NAME=<database name>
 
DB_USER=<name database user>

DB_PASS=<password database user>
```

### Also You need to install:
```sudo apt install ffmpeg```
```sudo apt install fprobe```

## Spin up a development environment

To start developing the bot, first run the postgres-in-docker instance.

```bash
./scripts/start_database.sh
```

Also, go to BotFather on Telegram and set up a test bot (don't forget to turn on inline mode). Set the token in your environment. The rest of the defaults for the database you are running are already in the root `.env` file. After you verify that your database started successfully, run the bot with `python3 bot.py` (assuming you have all the necessary depenencies installed).
